Netflix restricts content based on regions due to licensing agreements. This can prevent access to certain movies. Using a proxy allows you to bypass geo-blocks and access all Netflix content, no matter where you are.

## Why Some Movies Arenâ€™t Available
Netflixâ€™s content varies by country, as movie rights are sold regionally. This results in geo-blocking, limiting access to certain movies in specific regions.

## How Proxies Help
A proxy routes your internet traffic through an IP in another country, making Netflix think youâ€™re browsing from that location. This allows you to bypass restrictions and watch geo-blocked content. Proxies can also improve privacy and are often faster than VPNs for streaming.
